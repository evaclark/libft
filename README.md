# libft
First project of 42 Curcus - making a library of standard functions + addidional functions not included in the library
All pass norminette, compile and pass Libftest & 42-Curcus-Tester
Error occured while testing ft_strtrim && ft_substr in moulinette - most likely just a problem with ft_substr
